            /*
            - A call stack is a data structure used to keep track of functions, methods and procedures in a program.
            - It organizes inforation about the active routines of a program and is needed to manage the execution of fuction calls
            - It relates to recursion because recursion relies on the call stack to keep track of the different states of the recursive function calls
            - Each recursive call adds a layer to the stack, and each return peels a layer off
            */
        // Put your answer for #9 here:
            /*
            - The output would just return in the same order, no changes
            */
        // Put your answer for #10 here:
            /*
            - Infinite loop because it calls itself before reading the next line
            */
        // Put your answer for #11 here:
            /*
            - There is no base case
            - Can be an issue if y is 0
            */
        // Put your answer for #17 here:
            /*
            - Need to change it to < 10 in the base case
            - This will keep running forever in the case that it is less than 10
