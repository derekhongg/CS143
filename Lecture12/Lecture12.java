        // Self-Check Problems:
        // Section 14.1: Stack/Queue Basics

        // 1. Which of the following statements about stacks and queues is true?

        // A. Stacks and queues can store only integers as their data.
        // B. A stack returns elements in the same order as they were added (first-in,
        // first-out).
        // C. A queue’s remove method removes and returns the element at the front of
        // the
        // queue.
        // D. Stacks and queues are similar to lists, but less efficient.
        // E. The peek method allows access to the element at the bottom of a stack.

        // 2. What is a real-world example of data that could be modeled using a stack?
        // Using a queue?

        // 3. When you call push on a stack, where is the new element placed relative to
        // the other elements in the stack?
        // When you call pop, which element from the stack is returned?

        // 4. When you call add on a queue, where is the new element placed relative to
        // the other elements in the queue?
        // When you call remove, which element from the queue is returned?

        // 5. If you create a new empty stack and push the values 1, 2, and 3 in that
        // order, and call pop on the stack once, what value will be returned?

        // 6. If you create a new empty queue and add the values 1, 2, and 3 in that
        // order, and call remove on the queue once, what value will be returned?

        // Section 14.2: Common Stack/Queue Operations

        // 12. Stacks and queues have less functionality than other similar collections
        // like lists and maps.
        // Why are they still useful despite lacking functionality? What possible
        // advantages are there of using a less powerful collection?

        // 13. What is the output of the following code?
        // Do this by hand to make sure that you understand stacks and queues

        // 14. What is the output of the following code?
        // Do this by hand to make sure that you understand stacks and queues

        // 22. Write a piece of code that prints the elements of a queue of integers,
        // one per line.
        // When your code is done running, the queue should still contain the same
        // contents as it had at the start. In other words, don’t destroy the queue as
        // you print it. If you like, put your code into a method called print that
        // accepts the queue as a parameter.

        // 23. Write a piece of code that finds and prints the longest string in a stack
        // of strings.

        // For example, in the stack [hello, hi, goodbye, howdy], the longest string is
        // "goodbye". When your code is done running, the stack should still contain the
        // same contents as it had at the start. In other words, if you destroy the
        // stack as you examine it, restore its state afterward. If you like, put your
        // code into a method called printLongest that accepts the stack as a parameter.

        // Exercises:

        // None
