            /*
            Recursion is when a method calls on itself to solve smaller occurances of the same problem
            It differs from a standard iterative method because it repeats upon itself until the case is solved directly
            */
        // Put your answer for #2 here:
            /*
            Base case: The condition where recursion ends. The method needs to know when to end and the base case keeps it from running forever
            Recursive case: This part calls on itself to bring itself closer to the base case
