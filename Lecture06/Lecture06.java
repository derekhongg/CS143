        /*
         * Recursion is when a method calls on itself to solve smaller occurances of the
         * same problem
         * It differs from a standard iterative method because it repeats upon itself
         * until the case is solved directly
         */
        // Put your answer for #2 here:
        /*
         * Base case: The condition where recursion ends. The method needs to know when
         * to end and the base case keeps it from running forever
         * Recursive case: This part calls on itself to bring itself closer to the base
         * case
