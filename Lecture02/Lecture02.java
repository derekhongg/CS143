        // 1. What is an ArrayList? In what cases should you use an ArrayList rather
        // than an array?
            /* 
            An array list is a collection of data stored in an order of sequenced elements
            - Some ways you would need to use an ArrayList over an array is if you need dynamic sizing requirements that require you to add or subtract from the array
            - ArrayLists provide easier methods to work with than Arrays. Such as sorting, searching, or modifying.
